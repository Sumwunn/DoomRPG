## Fork overview

The main goal of this fork is bugfixing/stability & performance improvements. However some usability/gameplay tweaks have been made here and there.
I recommended reading CHANGELOG.txt and the commits for all the changes.

## Installing

* GZDoom v3.2.5 or higher is required to play this mod. 
Avoid v3.3 as it has an [ACS bug](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?style=12&f=7&t=60049) that causes performance issues.

[Refer to the Wiki.](https://github.com/Kyle873/DoomRPG/wiki)

## Compatible mods

- DoomRL Arsenal - [1.05] [MP-B6.2].
- LegenDoom v2.4.
- Colourful Hell v0.95.
- Custom version of Jimmy's Jukebox Instant Randomizer has been included which allows DRPG's map events and Outpost music to play.

## Notes

I hope my fork has achieved some stability at least, I haven't had any crashes in a while so that's nice but testing for total stability isn't possible.
- If you wish to submit a PR, please make sure your changes haven't affected the stability of DRPG itself. DRPG is very sensitive creature. Must be handled gently. Also please use the GDCC version listed in Links.txt.
- Refer to Links.txt for all required tools for compiling.
- I will try to keep mod compatibilty updated as fast as I can.
- I (Sumwunn) am personally not comfortable with making any gameplay related changes (balance and stuff) so 99% of the time you will just see bugfixes from me.
- I'm just a fan of DoomRPG and want to keep it functioning. I'm not experienced (very, very, new to C), and very much learning as I go, so feel free to offer any comments. I'm also looking at the TODO list and seeing which I can accomplish. Starting with the small tasks of course!
- I'll be adding notes to this README off 'n on.
