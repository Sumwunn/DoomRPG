Added header & help to Item Roulette.

The fix for GetRewardItem from BUILD 16 was causing Item Roulette to spit out junk.

- Some UDMF maps exit via scripts, bypassing DRPG's own script. Those will need to edited manually in SLADE. Replace the following exits in SLADE:

---- Teleport_NewMap(X,Y,Z); is replaced with: ACS_Execute(30001, 0, X, Y, Z); - Replace X,Y,Z with the arguments from Teleport_NewMap()
----- Then compile the edited script in SLADE and then delete the old BEHAVIOUR file (should be just after the map marker) after the new one is spat out.
